<h2> HELLO! </h2> 

I'm a playwright, composer, lyricist, and researcher based in Milwaukee, WI.
My work most often deals with Asian-Americans grappling with the messiness of
their identities. I'm also a technologist and am interested in building new
theater experiences that mesh with technology. My work has been developed and
produced with Underscore Theatre Company, the National Asian American Theatre
Company (NAATCO), Musical Theatre Factory, PACE University, the O'Neill Theatre
Center (NPC '22), the National Alliance for Musical Theatre (NAMT '22)
Faultline Theatre in San Francisco, and Shotgun Players.
