<h2> HELLO! </h2> 

I'm a playwright, composer, lyricist, and researcher based in the Bay Area, CA. 
My work most often deals with Asian-Americans grappling with the messiness of
their identities as they relate to their unique American experiences.

I'm also a technologist and computing researcher, and am intersested in
building new theater experiences that mesh with technology.
