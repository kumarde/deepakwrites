<h2> HELLO! </h2> 
I'm a playwright, composer, lyricist, and researcher based in San Diego, CA.  I
write about the questions that keep me up at night, whether they be about
Asianness, technology, youth, board games, or soul-eating demons.  I'm also a
<a href="https://kumarde.com" target="_blank"> professor in Computer Science</a>, and this very much informs my
writing practice.  My work has been developed and produced all over, with some
highlights including the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center (NPC '22), the National
Alliance for Musical Theatre (NAMT '22), Theo, Village Theatre, and Prospect
Theatre Company.

I'm a MacDowell Colony fellow and I'm currently on commision by Audible Theatre
and Arena Stage.
