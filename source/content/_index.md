<h2> HELLO! </h2> 

I'm a playwright and composer based in the Bay Area, CA. 

My work most often deals with Asian-Americans grappling with the messiness of
their identities (asian, daughter, student, whatever) as they relate to their
unique American experiences. I'm also a technologist and computing researcher,
and am intersested in building new theater experiences with technology.
