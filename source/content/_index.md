<h2> HELLO! </h2> 

I'm a playwright, composer, lyricist, and researcher based in the Bay Area, CA.
My work most often deals with Asian-Americans grappling with the messiness of
their identities as they relate to their unique American experiences. I'm also
a technologist and am interested in building new theater experiences that mesh
with technology. I have worked with Underscore Theatre Company in Chicago, the
National Asian American Theatre Company (NAATCO), Musical Theatre Factory, and
PACE University in NYC, Faultline Theatre in San Francisco, and Shotgun Players
in Berkeley, CA.
